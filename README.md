## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/VidyaSrivatsan/Getting-Started-with-Asciidoc/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Asciidoc

AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.

This guide provides a gentle introduction to AsciiDoc, a plain text documentation syntax and how to produce Asciidoc using visual studio code.


For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/VidyaSrivatsan/Getting-Started-with-Asciidoc/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
